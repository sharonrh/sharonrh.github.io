Waow, finally I got myself some free time. I've been thinking of trying Jekyll and GitHub Pages since a few months ago, but I still had my thesis at that time (screw you!).

Anyway, I still don't know what specific role this site will play. Another non-*engineerish* blog, maybe? Sounds good, using free Wordpress blog is somehow constraining. Huh, but it is hosted in GitHub, you say? Does that make it illegal for me to write normal things? >:O

Aah.. screw it. I'll just find a nice theme first.
